# Gollection <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/golang.png" width="50" height="50"> 

Is a repository containing several very small Golang projects written during bootcamps & learning sessions in which I've participated in 2021 and 2022.

To execute those programs, you simply need to have a Golang installed (currently using v1.16.4) installed.

And run the program by typing:

````
go run ./main.go
````
