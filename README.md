# Golang little projects

Repository containing several very small Golang projects written during Bootcamp sessions & learning session in which I've participated in 2021 and 2022.

To execute those programs, you simply need to have a Golang installed (currently using v1.16.4) installed.

And run the program by typing:

````
go run ./main.go
````
