This repository contains some small Golang projects written during bootcamps & learning sessions in which I've participated across 2021 and 2022.

To execute those programs, you simply need to have [Golang](https://go.dev/) installed (currently using v1.16.4) installed.

And run the program by typing:

````
go run ./main.go
````
